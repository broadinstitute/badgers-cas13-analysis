# dragon-cas13-analysis

This repository contains scripts used to the generative algorithms used to design artificial guides, analyze their performance, and generate the display items shown in the DRAGON manuscript. 

**Please see the [main repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/dragon-cas13) for more information on the algorithms and how they can be run.**

## Summary of contents
Below is a summary of this repository's contents:
* `figures/`: Contains the scripts used to generate the display items included in the manuscript.
* `detection/`: Contains the scripts used to evaluate the algorithms on the multi-target detection objective.
* `discrimination/`: Contains the scripts used to evaluate the algorithms on the variant identification objective.
* `experimental/`: Contains the guide and target sequences used in the evaluation of the algorithms, along with the fluorescence data.
