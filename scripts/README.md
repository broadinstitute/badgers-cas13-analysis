## File Overview

cbas.py and cbas_helper_funcs.py run the CbAS algorithm to design guide sequences. These scripts use the same scripting structure as the FLEXS CbAS implementation, and use the VAE architecture of the original CbAS publication.
The AdaLead algorithm was run using the script published in the [FLEXS version 0.2.7](https://github.com/samsinai/FLEXS/tree/master) implementation.
